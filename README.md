# RLC Simulator
A simple simulator to visulize (and audio-ize (?)) an RLC circuit.

## Features
- a simulated lightbulb (resistor), capacitor, and inductor with adjustable values
- a graph of the current against time
- dynamic music, changing volume with the power through the resistor
- a pulse (with sound effect) to indicate the local extrema of the current
- a noise shader, changing opacity with the power through the resistor

## Usage
Step 1: Adjust the given values for resistance, capacitance, and inductance

Step 2: Press play and optionally pause to pause the simulation

Step 3: Press reset and repeat from step 1

## Credits
### Music/Sound Effects
Samples from "Reverie for Another Sphere" - Taishi

## Notes
The name of the repository and some features may feel extraneous to a simple RLC circuit simulator.
This is due to progress towards, but ultimate failiar in gamifying the simulator.
